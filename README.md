# Easier Ring of Pain
A mod for Ring of Pain that makes the game easier.

**Requries BepInEx**
If you don't know what this means, see: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx
To install, go to Releases, go to BepInEx 6.X.X (should be first in the list), go to Assets, and click BepInEx_UnityIL2CPP_x64_6.X.X
Once downloaded, extract the files into your Ring of Pain folder, and run the game.
In your Ring of Pain folder, go to the BepInEx folder. Wait until a "plugins" folder is created. **This may take some time.**
Close the game once the folder has been created.
Put the "EasierRingOfPain.dll" file found in this repository into the plugins folder.
Relaunch the game. The mod should be working.
(Optional) - Go to BepInEx/config/BepInEx.cfg. Open it with Notepad or something similar. Scroll down until you see "[Logging.Console]". Set "Enabled = false" to true.
This will allow you to see a console upon running the game that will list any bugs that may occur.

Current Features:
- Whenever the player loses or gains soul, gain 1 soul.
- The player takes halved damage from explosions and potion curses.
